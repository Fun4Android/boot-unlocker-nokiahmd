## BootUnlocker for HMD Nokia Devices -- Get capability of unlocking bootoader

Following info comes from original repo and haven't been modified yet.

You've rooted your device, and you are trying to decide between the security of relocking your bootloader (with stock recovery and USB Debugging off), and the flexibility of leaving it unlocked.
You know that in order to prevent an unauthorized user from accessing your data by flashing a custom recovery, fastboot oem unlock wipes your data. This also means that if you relock your bootloader, you will need to do a full backup-and-restore whenever you decide to unlock it again.
BootUnlocker for Nexus Devices lets you have the best of both worlds by using root privileges to unlock your bootloader from within Android, without wiping your data. This allows you to keep your bootloader locked for security, with this application safely protected behind your lockscreen password. Whenever you want to unlock or relock your bootloader, just unlock your screen and run BootUnlocker.
