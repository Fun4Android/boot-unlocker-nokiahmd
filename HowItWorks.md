This application REQUIRES a Nokia 5 (ND1 or D1A) or Nokia 6 (D1C or PLE) with root.

BootUnlocker for Nokia devices will allow you to unlock bootloader once executed.

The bootloader unlocking capability uses at position 0x00003101 of the "deviceinfo" partition, stored as 00 / FF.

BootUnlocker uses root privileges to write to to the appropriate location directly, then you'll be able to unlock the bootloader.
